Introduction to Statistical Computing with R
--------------------------------------------

An introduction to R, R Markdown, and simple statistical analysis with R.
Includes basic functions in R, manipulating dataframes, plotting, and a brief
intro to general linear models.

General Linear Model with lm()
-------------------

This tutorial provides an introduction to using ``lm()`` to run a general linear model analysis. 
We walk through additive and interactive models, including quadratic terms in your model, 
model comparison, and interactions with multiple continuous variables.

Logistic Regression
-------------------

This tutorial provides an introduction to logistic regression. Using an example
dataset from class, we walk through a ``glm()`` analysis, and discuss the
interpretation of results in terms of the data.

Binomial Probability Theory
---------------------------

This tutorial walks through the basic probability theory of binomially
distributed random variables and shows how that theory can be levereged to
perform null hypothesis tests, estimation, prediction, and how it forms the
basis for logistic regression.

Maximum Likelihood
--------------------
An overview of the principle of maximum likelihood and the derivation of the likelihood ratio test statistic.

Bootstrapping
--------------------
A short primer on non-parametric statistics, in particular, the bootstrap. There is also an 
overview of several R functions written by Desmond Ong to assist in calculating bootstrapped
statistics. Download functions from `here <https://github.com/desmond-ong/doBootstrap>`_.
